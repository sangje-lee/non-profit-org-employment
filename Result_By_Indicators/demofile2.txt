
	Hello, I am interested in taking your Foundations of Improv start from next week.

I have questions before enroll in this program.

    Is this the beginner level of improv?
    How much is it? but depend on the payment methods, the price is higher.
    If I am unable to attend one class, do you guy have make up class?

Thank you.

Sincerely,
